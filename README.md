# About
Hi, my name is Connor!  <br> <br>
I recently graduated (July 2023) with a degree in mathematics (MMath)! <br> <br>
My time at university has taught me that my true passion lies in combining mathematics with programming. <br> <br>
To date, I have primarily used MATLAB and R-Studio to complement my studies, but have dabbled in Python, SQL, HTML and CSS during my free time.
Currently, I am self studying to improve my understanding of foundational machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) concepts. <br> <br>
I am eager to further my abilities and eventually make a career out of my efforts.
